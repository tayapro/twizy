# Project Description

tWIZY is a CLI-based quiz game that challenges players with a variety of common questions. Players can earn points by answering questions correctly to achieve high scores, with the goal of becoming a champion on the leaderboard.

The game uses Google Sheets as a database to store both the quiz questions and the records of top players. This setup allows for easy updates and management of data.

tWIZY game is deployed on Heroku, making it accessible and convenient for players to enjoy from anywhere.

The tWIZY CLI app is built using Python and a little HTML, CSS as a Portfolio Project#3 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer(e-Commerce) course.
